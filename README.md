# GPU QuickSort

This project aim to implement an High Performance version of the QuickSort Algorithm.

With such objective in mind, this project contains several implementation of the algorithm which have different level of Optimization.

In any case, it has been exploied the GPU Programming as base framework for all implementation.


That said, all code of this project was made using *C language* for the Host and *OpenCL* language for the device (GPU).
